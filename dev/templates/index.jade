				h2 What does being on the first page mean?
				h3 Why SEO drives leads

				img.inBody(src="img/seo.png")  

				p You've heard great things about SEO and getting to the top of Google. But what does it mean to be there?
				p The short answer is more traffic to your website, and of course, more traffic means more leads & sales for your team.
				ul
					li 80% of organic traffic is captured by top 3 results
					li 72% of all traffic goes to organic search results
					li AdWords only captures 28% of all searches for all ads 

				p We have a SEO product that will take your lead aquisition to the next level.

				h4 SEO is a power hitter, delivering:

				ul
					li Increased Traffic - Top positions receive majority of impressions and clicks
					li ROI - Trackable and quantifiable results - rank improvements, traffic, leads
					li Cost Effective - Users are actively looking for homes/real estate online
					li Brand Awareness - Significant search impressions translates to more exposure
					li Better Conversion Rates - Visitors more likely to become customers
					li Bypass Competition - Your site is optimized, the competition's isn't. Who is more successful?

				p SEO is about more than simply outranking the competition for the top spot. It's about marketing your content and ranking multiple pages for multiple search terms, so that when people search, they only get results that point to your pages.

				h4 Our SEO Packages include:

				ul
					li Keyword Analysis - Identifies the most profitable keywords to dominate
					li Content Promotion - Content distribution, backlinking to increase authority
					li Linking & indexing - Ensures content & links are completely indexed by Google
					li SEO Reporting - How your rank is improving, analytical data showing traffic improvements

				p We recommend the Business package for smaller markets and teams and Professional/Elite for larger markets, or teams looking to dominate the organic search results across multiple pages.

				p You can enjoy top positioning in your marketplace, capturing rankings of high-value, targeted keywords across multiple ranking positions, all working together to generate the new wave of leads you need.

				h2 High-Impact Lead Generation

				img.sem(src="img/SEM.png")  

				p Having your site show up for high-value search queries is everything. We use Search Advertising to position your website on search engines, capturing precise, targeted searchers actively looking to buy or sell in your local real estate market.

				ul
					li AdWords captures 28% of all search engine queries
					li Search Advertising is a direct response strategy that is able to generate immediate traffic and leads
					li By targeting keywords, we capture lower sales funnel traffic that is more likely to result in a paying customer, not just another lead

				h4 Search & Display Advertising Delivers:

				P Research and selection of keywords, or search queries, that are most relevant to your business, creating 'keyword groupings' that are paired with tailored ads. Some accounts may have up to 30,000 keyword variations for targeting.

				p Search Advertising (AdWords, Yahoo!/Bing) is an auction based model where both a bid and a 'Quality Score' determine where and when your ad is shown. We optimize these two variables for each keyword in your campaign, all based on lead generation performance and your cost-per-head. 

				h4 Our Search & Display Advertising Package includes:

				ul
					li Keyword Research & Campaign Structuring - Structuring your keywords and ads for maximum efficiency
					li Account Optimization - Prioritizing individual keywords based on lead generation performance
					li Reporting - Detailed performance data including advertising costs, lead generated, and cost-per-lead

				p All activity is Pay-Per-Click (PPC) based and designed around lead generation.

				p We recommend a minimum of $500 for smaller markets and teams and $1000-$1500 for larger <strong>markets, or teams looking to dominate the advertising space.</strong>

				p There's a reason Search Advertising is wide-spread and efficient - the more you spend, the more you get in return.

				h4 Social Advertising Delivers:

				ul
					li Website visitor retargeting: Re-engage Facebook users who bounced from your site without registering, giving them a reason to reconsider your team with a strong call to action.
					li Retarget at the property type level: it's now possible to re-engage visitors based on the property type they last viewed on your website, reaching out to them with tailored and creative messaging.
					li Detailed demographic targeting: Target home owners in your area that may be interested in selling. A wide range of demographic is available for targeting, including: age, martial status, home ownership status, individual income.

				p Facebook Advertising is not only great at capturing a demographically relevant audience - your brand recognition will increase, producing a halo effect in other marketing channels.
