        <h3>Why SEO drives leads</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="img/seo.png" class="inBody">
        <p>You've heard great things about SEO and getting to the top of Google. But what does it mean to be there?</p>
        <br>
        <p>The short answer is more traffic to your website, and of course, more traffic means more leads & sales for your team.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li class="first sections"><i class="fa fa-check"></i> 80% of organic traffic is captured by top 3 results</li>
            <li class="sections"><i class="fa fa-check"></i> 72% of all traffic goes to organic search results</li>
            <li class="sections"><i class="fa fa-check"></i> AdWords only captures 28% of all searches for all ads</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>We have a SEO product that will take your lead aquisition to the next level.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="gray">SEO is a power hitter, delivering:</h4>
        <br>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>SEO is about more than simply outranking the competition for the top spot. It's about marketing your content and ranking multiple pages for multiple search terms, so that when people search, they only get results that point to your pages.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>Search Advertising (AdWords, Yahoo!/Bing) is an auction based model where both a bid and a 'Quality Score' determine where and when your ad is shown. We optimize these two variables for each keyword in your campaign, all based on lead generation
            performance and your cost-per-lead.</p>
